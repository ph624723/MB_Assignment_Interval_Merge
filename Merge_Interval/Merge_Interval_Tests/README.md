# Merge_Interval_Tests

Unit test project. 
Contains unit testing for the implemented interval operations. 

Only contains a dummy implementation as of now. Full testing should include more varied and larger datasets to be tested. In case a dedicated Interval class is continued to be used, any implemented methods should also be tested.
